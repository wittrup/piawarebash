# piawarebash

Prepared a setup [PiAware](https://flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/) setup for a remote location.
Just for the record I made a [log of the commands](https://github.com/wittrup/piawarebash/blob/master/installation.md) I use after installation and this git with some of the scripts intended to use.

**Features of this setup:**
- Expand for lagre SD
- Download this git
- Vim text editor (what i prefer)
- Change hostname
- WiFi setup
- Automatic ssh login using ssh keys
- Setup scripts: Reverse SSH tunnel (persistent)
